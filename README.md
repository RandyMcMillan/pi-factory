### _Create your own bitcoin lightning box!_

This repository lets you build a _bitcoin lightning_ box for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) 3 Model B & 3B+ based on [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) Linux.

**Work in progress.** While stable enough for development, this software is subject to change, some of which may be breaking changes.
**Warning!** *Do not put money at stake that you are not willing to lose!*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lncm/pi-factory.svg?branch=v0.5)](https://travis-ci.com/lncm/pi-factory)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/noma/badge/?version=latest)](https://pi-factory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


### Features

* `Tor` onion-routing for enhanced privacy and improved connectivity
* Lightning Labs' `LND` bundled with our *autoconnect* and *autounlock* tools
* Bitcoin Core `bitcoind` bundled with our implementation of Nicholas Dorier's *fastsync* to drastically reduce initial sync time
* `Alpine Linux`, a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl *libc* and `Busybox`
* Containerization of most components including `nginx`, `iotwifi`, `invoicer`, `bitcoind`, `lnd`
* *Stateless OS* - the microSD card image can be replaced with a newer version *without loss of user data*
* Simple `shell`, `Python` scripts and `Go` backends enable easy auditing and provide a small *attack surface*
* `Docker` & `docker-compose` make updates easier and orchestration painless
* [Future] the microSD card can be mounted in read-only mode for zero-wear operation
* [Future] Redundant storage persistence using RAID 


### LNCM components

* [invoicer](https://github.com/lncm/invoicer): lightweight `bitcoind` and `LND` backend in Go.
* [invoicer-ui](https://github.com/lncm/invoicer-ui): Point of Sale for Bitcoin and Lightning in React.
* [iotwifi-ui](https://github.com/lncm/iotwifi-ui): Wi-Fi connection wizard in React.
* [noma](https://github.com/lncm/noma): CLI node management utility and API in Python.
* [docker-bitcoind](https://github.com/lncm/docker-bitcoind): arm & amd64 support
* [docker-berkeleydb](https://github.com/lncm/docker-berkeleydb): arm & amd64 support
* [docker-lnd](https://github.com/lncm/docker-lnd): arm & amd64 support


Hardware Requirements
---------------------

* **Raspberry Pi**
    * Recommended: model 3B+
    * Optional: case, heatsink, LAN cable
    
    We recommend using a heatsink on 3B+ models to unlock their full sustained performance. Useful, e.g. during syncing or filtering blocks.
    
* **microSD** card
    * Recommended: SanDisk 16GB or more
    * microSD card to USB adapter or built-in hardware
    
    Quality goes over quantity here!
    
* **USB storage** devices
   * Recommended: 4 USB flash drives of 16GB or more
   * Alternatively for bitcoin full-archival nodes: 
        * 2 or 3 flash devices
        * a hard drive or SSD for the blockchain
        
   You may need to use a powered USB hub to prevent undervoltage when using some hard drives.

* **Power Supply** (5V/2.5A) with micro-USB cable
    * Recommended: official Raspberry Pi power supply
    * Alternatively: 
        * high-quality USB charger (e.g. Samsung)
        * short USB to micro-USB cable. (a longer cable can work with 5.1V chargers)
    
    **Warning!** Your Raspberry Pi will *not work* properly without a correctly rated power supply and cable.
    
    You **risk losing bitcoin** and **data** when running your Raspberry Pi in an underpowered state. 
    
Instructions
------------

1. Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) 
    * *Experienced users:* it is possible to use `dd` instead
2. Download latest [lncm-box.img.zip](
https://github.com/lncm/pi-factory/releases/download/v0.4.1/lncm-box-v0.4.1.img.zip)
3. Run Etcher and follow on-screen instructions to burn `lncm-box.img.zip` to microSD card 
4. Place the SD card in your *Raspberry Pi*
5. Connect your *Raspberry Pi* to a **correctly rated power supply**
6. If you are using wired *LAN*: 
    * connect the cable to your Pi 
    * is your LAN cable active? 
        * congratulations, you are done!
7. If you are using *WiFi*: 
    * find a device with a *web browser* and *WiFi*, e.g. your smartphone or laptop
8. On your device, search for and connect to a *WiFi* network called **LNCM-Box**
    * Password: **lncm box**
9. Open the *web browser* on your device, e.g. `Chrome` or `Safari`
    * Navigate to "[http://box.local/wifi](http://box.local/wifi)"
    * Choose your *WiFi* network from the list
    * Type in your password & *connect*

Your **lightning box** will automatically start installing itself to *microSD* card once it has an internet connection. This usually takes less than *15 minutes* depending on the speed of your card and internet connection.

Once the box has *synced* up the **invoicing** service will be available at [http://box.local/pos](http://box.local/pos). Depending on the speed of your internet connection and your USB storage devices the process may take *30 minutes* to *an hour* or more.

Access
------

### Users & Passwords

* lncm
    - **username**: lncm
    - **password**: chiangmai


* root
    - **username**: root
    - **password**: chiangmai

**Note:** `sudo` is not installed, use `su` instead

### Command-line via ssh
`ssh lncm@box.local`

**Note:** First boot will take some time as ssh host keys are generated.

### Connect to WiFi hotspot

The Raspberry Pi lightning box provides it's own WiFi hotspot to ease access and configuration.

- **WiFi name** (SSID): "LNCM-Box"
- **WiFi password**: "lncm box"


- **IP address**: 192.168.27.1
- **hostname**: box.local

### WiFi hotspot

The box provides it's own WiFi hotspot to ease access and configuration.

- **WiFi name** (SSID): "LNCM-Box"
- **WiFi password**: "lncm box"
- **IP address**: 192.168.27.1
- **hostname**: box.local

#### Advanced configuration

If the wifi configuration manager does not work (currently there is an issue where the wifi manager is not getting downloaded), you may SSH in and invoke the following command.

```bash
curl -w "\n" -d '{"ssid":"YOUR-SSID-NAME", "psk":"YOUR-PASSWORD"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST http://192.168.27.1:8080/connect
```

Alternatively, when building the image you can create a ```wpa_supplicant.automatic.conf``` file with all your wifi passwords.

Building
--------
To generate a fresh image from source run `make_img.sh` as __root__ on a *Debian*, *Ubuntu* or *Alpine* system.

For convenience, we also support `vagrant` to automate setting up your development VM.

### MacOS instructions:

Install dependencies ([homebrew](https://brew.sh), virtualbox, vagrant):
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
git clone pi-factory
cd pi-factory
```

Create VM and generate image:
* `vagrant up`

Rebuild image without wiping VM:
* `vagrant up --provision`

Also useful:
* `vagrant ssh`
* `vagrant halt`
* `vagrant destroy -f`
* `brew cask install vagrant-manager` (optional menu-bar utility)
